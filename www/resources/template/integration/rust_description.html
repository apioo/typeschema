The Rust TypeSchema integration uses the well known <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a> library.
To use the generated DTO classes you need to add this library to your project:

<pre><code class="text">[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
</code></pre>
