# TypeSchema

## About

TypeSchema is a JSON format to describe data models in a language neutral format. A TypeSchema specification can be
easily transformed into code for almost any programming language. This helps to reuse core data models in different
environments. More information at: [https://typeschema.org](https://typeschema.org)

The TypeSchema meta specification which describes the specification itself is located at `./specification/typeschema.json`.
We automatically push the specification to the [TypeHub platform](https://app.typehub.cloud/d/typehub/typeschema) where
you can see also a rendered version of the specification and download the auto generated models.
