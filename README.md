# TypeSchema

## About

TypeSchema is a JSON format to describe data models in a language neutral format. A TypeSchema specification can be
easily transformed into code for almost any programming language. This helps to reuse core data models in different
environments. More information at: [https://typeschema.org](https://typeschema.org)

The TypeSchema specification is developed at the [TypeHub platform](https://app.typehub.cloud/d/typehub/typeschema)
which is a collaborative platform to design TypeSchema and TypeAPI specifications.
