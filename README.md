# TypeSchema

## About

TypeSchema is a JSON format to describe data models in a language neutral
format. A TypeSchema can be easily transformed into specific code for almost any
programming language. This helps to reuse core data models in different
environments. More information at: [https://typeschema.org](https://typeschema.org)

## TypeHub

[TypeHub](https://typehub.cloud/) is a collaborative platform to design open data
specifications, it is like GitHub but instead of code we model data.

## Schemas

Please take a look at our [Model](https://github.com/apioo/psx-model) repository
where we have TypeSchema specifications of popular schema specifications like
i.e. OpenAPI etc. You can also use those specifications to generate data models
in your preferred language.
